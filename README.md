# BharatIntern-machine-learning
This is the bharatintern virtual intership task repository.

Intership Domain is Machine Learning.


In this repository all three tasks are present. 

Task 1:

Model Used : Linear Regression.
Used tools : Scripted in Python programing launguage.
Libraries:   Numpy ,Pandas , Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit -learn
Goal:        Utilise a dataset of real estate information to capture trends and patterns in the market and Prices of the houses. Considers essential features like   
             Area, amenities, and more, to provide highly accurate predictions.
Steps Performed:
1. Detailed EDA: After collecting and understanding the data ,performed Exploratory data analysis to mining deeper in the data.
2. Checked for multi-Collinearity.
3. Data wrangling/ Outliers Treatment: Cleaning, Dropping duplicates, and imputing & removed outliers.
4. Feature scaling / Data transformation: One hot Encoding, Label encoding,Normalization, standardization, encoding categorical variables, or feature scaling.
5. Feature Engineering: selecting relevant features which can improve the model's performance.
6. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set.
7. Model Selection: Selected the appropriate linear regression model based on the problem requirements.
8. Model Training: Finally our model is trained on the training data. The goal is to find the best-fitting line.
9. Model Prediction: It is ready to make predictions on new, unseen data.
10.Model Evaluation: After training, appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) & R-squred score.
